## [1] Distributions

1. Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
2. Central Limit Theorem
3. Q-Q PLot


## [2] EDA: Exploratory data analysis

1. EDA of Haberman's Survival dataset
2. EDA of Titanic Mortality dataset.


## [3] KNN

> Note: Create folder by name `Output` inside `3. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)`
folder before funning the notebook.

Objective of `K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).ipynb` notebook:

1. Plot cluster of data-point.
2. Implementing KNN algorithm from scratch.
3. Test the accuracy of the model trained on KNN.


## [4] Naive Bayes classifier

Objective of `Naive Bayes Classifier.ipynb` notebook:

1. Implement simple Naive Bayes classifier for categorical features.
2. Train and test model on sample weather forecast dataset using Naive Bayes.

Objective of `Naive Bayes Classifier - CategoricalNB.ipynb` notebook:

1. Train Naive Bayes classifier using `CategoricalNB` from `sklearn`.
2. Train and test model on sample weather forecast dataset.
